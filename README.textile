h1. Bees with Machine Guns!

h2. Description

A utility for arming (creating) many bees (micro EC2 instances) to attack (load test) targets (web applications).

h2. Dependencies

* Python 2.6
* boto
* paramiko

h2. Installation for users

Preferred:

<pre>
pip install beeswithmachineguns
</pre>

or, if you must:

<pre>
easy_install beeswithmachineguns
</pre>

h2. Installation for developers (w/ virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper)

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns.git
cd beeswithmachineguns
mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages bees
easy_install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

h2. Configuring EC2 credentials

Bees uses boto to communicate with EC2 and thus supports all the same methods of storing credentials that it does.  These include declaring environment variables, machine-global configuration files, and per-user configuration files. You can read more about these options on "boto's configuration page":http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig

h2. Usage

A type bees session looks something like this:

<pre>
bees up -s 4 -g public -k frakkingtoasters
bees attack -n 10000 -c 250 -u http://www.ournewwebbyhotness.com/
bees down
</pre>

This spins up 4 servers in security group 'public' using the EC2 keypair 'frakkingtoasters', whose private key is expected to reside at ~/.ssh/frakkingtoasters.pem.

It then uses those 4 servers to send 10,000 requests, 250 at a time, to attack OurNewWebbyHotness.com.

Lastly, it spins down the 4 servers.  Please remember to do this--we aren't responsible for your EC2 bills.

For complete options type:

<pre>
bees -h
</pre>
